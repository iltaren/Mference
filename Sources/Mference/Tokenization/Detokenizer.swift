/// Streaming detokenizer for generation loops.
///
/// A Gemma tokenizer that declares the pinned decoder sequence takes the
/// lossless path: each token contributes its own fragment, byte-fallback runs
/// commit as a whole (`GemmaDecoding`, `ByteFallbackRun`), and the cost is O(1)
/// per token. Callers split the stream at channel and tool markers by flushing
/// and starting a fresh detokenizer, so a run never spans a marker. A ChatML
/// byte-level tokenizer with clean-up off (Qwen) takes `ByteLevelDecoding`'s
/// incremental path, also O(1) per token and equal to the library decode.
/// Every other tokenizer re-decodes through the library as described below.
///
/// Four challenges drive the library-decode design:
///
/// 1. BPE byte-fallback splits multi-byte codepoints (e.g. emoji) across several
///    tokens. Naively decoding each token in isolation yields broken UTF-8.
/// 2. swift-transformers' decoder silently drops byte-fallback tokens that sit
///    at the **end** of the decoded sequence (the bytes are committed only once
///    a non-byte-fallback token follows). For us this matters at `flush()`.
/// 3. Byte-level BPE (Qwen) has no byte-fallback tokens at all: a scalar's UTF-8
///    bytes simply span ordinary tokens, and `ByteLevelDecoder` ends with
///    `String(decoding:as:)`, so a decode stopping mid-scalar already contains
///    U+FFFD. Nothing upstream of us can hold those bytes back.
/// 4. `Tokenizer.decode` applies `cleanUpTokenizationSpaces`, and it defaults to
///    **true** when `tokenizer_config.json` omits the key. Gemma omits it; Qwen
///    sets it false. Its rewrites delete a space an earlier decode already
///    emitted (" 's" -> "'s"), so on Gemma the decode genuinely is not
///    append-only and no amount of holding back can make it so.
///
/// Strategy:
///   - During `push(_:)` we decode the longest prefix of accumulated IDs that
///     does NOT end with byte-fallback tokens, then emit the delta vs. previously
///     emitted text. Any trailing byte-fallback IDs are held back.
///   - Also during `push(_:)`, a trailing run of U+FFFD in the decoded text is
///     withheld: it is the decoder's rendering of a scalar whose remaining bytes
///     are still in flight, and the next decode replaces it with the real
///     character. Interior U+FFFD is emitted normally.
///   - During `flush()` we decode the stable prefix as above AND manually
///     assemble the trailing byte-fallback bytes into a UTF-8 string. This
///     recovers text the library would otherwise drop on a sequence-ending
///     codepoint. `flush()` also releases any withheld U+FFFD, so a replacement
///     character the model genuinely produced — or a stream that really did stop
///     mid-scalar — still reaches the caller.
///   - When a decode contradicts text already handed out, the resync path emits
///     the divergent tail minus the part the caller has already seen, instead of
///     dropping it. The stale text cannot be retracted; losing characters on top
///     of that is strictly worse. On Gemma this is the difference between
///     streaming "do n't" and streaming "do n'".
///
/// `flush()` is terminal in the generation loop, but pushing afterwards is not a
/// trap: the committed prefix is clamped so that it can never rewind.
