# Local OpenAI-compatible server

`MferenceServer` exposes a local Chat Completions API for one installed
supported model. It binds to `127.0.0.1` by default, or to the machine's exact
Tailscale IPv4 address with `--bind tailnet`. It has no application-level
authentication or TLS; do not expose it through a wildcard interface, proxy,
or tunnel.

This document is the API: one model per process, named by `--model`. If you want
the **user interface** — a browser, a model picker, chats that persist — start
at [The Mference UI (Open WebUI)](OPEN_WEBUI.md) and run `./mference-ui.sh`,
which does everything below for you.

The `--library` mode that UI runs on serves every installed model from this one
process, listing them all in `/v1/models` and swapping the resident model in
place when a request names a different one. It changes nothing about the mode
described here, which is what runs whenever `--library` is absent. The UI guide
covers library mode, its model identifiers, the cost of a swap, and
[unloading the model](OPEN_WEBUI.md#unloading-the-model).

## Start the server

First, install the model with `MferenceRepack` or
`./mference-ui.sh install <family>`. Then check that no other Mference model
process is running:

```bash
pgrep -fl 'MferenceServer|MferenceCLI|MferencePackageTests|swiftpm-testing-helper|mlx_lm|mlx-lm'
```

If the command prints a match, do not start the server.

```bash
swift build -c release --product MferenceServer
.build/release/MferenceServer \
  --model scratch/gemma4.gturbo \
  --port 8080 \
  --max-context 16384
```

The server loads the model before opening the port. Wait for
`MferenceServer ready`, then keep the process running while clients use
it.

To reach the server from other devices in the same Tailnet, let it detect and
bind the machine's Tailscale IPv4 address:

```bash
.build/release/MferenceServer \
  --model scratch/gemma4.gturbo \
  --bind tailnet \
  --port 8080 \
  --max-context 32768 \
  --queue-limit 32
```

This requires the `tailscale` CLI on `PATH`. The server binds only that one
address; it never binds a wildcard interface. If Tailscale is missing, not
running, or reports anything other than a single Tailscale IPv4 address, the
command fails instead of falling back to a broader interface. The startup line
prints the address it actually bound.

`--bind tailnet` is not authentication. Access is governed entirely by the
Tailnet ACL, and every device the ACL admits gets unauthenticated access to the
full API. The server still has no application-level authentication or TLS.

Check the server from another terminal:

```bash
curl --silent --show-error http://127.0.0.1:8080/health
curl --silent --show-error http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/models
curl --silent --show-error http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "gemma-4-26b-a4b-it",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Reply with exactly READY."}],
    "temperature": 0,
    "max_completion_tokens": 16
  }'
```

By default, the server runs one generation and queues up to four requests. Use
`--queue-limit` to change the queue size. Press Control-C to stop the server.

Model integrity follows `--verify`, on the first load and on every library
swap. The default `auto` checks the routed-expert files against the install
receipt's sizes when that receipt validates and hashes them on first touch
otherwise; `--verify full-sha256` always hashes, which adds that time to the
first prefill after each load. See
[Runtime settings](RUNTIME_CONTROLS.md#runtime-settings) for the trade-off.

## Connect a client

The base URL is `http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1`. Some client libraries require an
API key, but the server ignores it.

Python:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(base_url="http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1", api_key="local")
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gemma-4-26b-a4b-it",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Say hello in one sentence."}],
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

OpenCode:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "provider": {
    "mference": {
      "npm": "@ai-sdk/openai-compatible",
      "name": "Mference",
      "options": {
        "baseURL": "http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1",
        "apiKey": "local"
      },
      "models": {
        "gemma-4-26b-a4b-it": {
          "name": "Gemma 4 26B-A4B IT"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Select `mference/gemma-4-26b-a4b-it` in OpenCode.

## Prompt reuse

Single-prefix KV reuse is on by default. Send the complete message history with
every request. When a request continues the retained conversation exactly, the
server reuses the verified KV prefix and reports the number of reused tokens in:

```text
usage.prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens
```

The server retains one prefix. A different or incompatible history replaces
it. Use `--prompt-cache-mode off` to disable reuse.

For Gemma, a new user message applies Google's thought-stripping template.
The server reuses the longest unchanged prefix whose state is still valid,
rewinding current KV or restoring one bounded sliding-window snapshot before
prefilling the remaining tokens. A tool continuation keeps the same snapshot;
a new user turn replaces it before generating thoughts. Full-attention prefix
rows stay in their original buffers. At most 199.81 MiB is allocated for the
pinned Gemma recovery image (less for short histories), only with caching on.
Missing state or incompatible history falls back to full prefill. Cancellation,
errors, model replacement and reset invalidate recovery. Clients continue to
send complete history; Qwen keeps its existing continuation behavior.

## Tool calls

The server can return OpenAI-style function calls, but it cannot authorize or
execute them. The client runs the tool loop:

1. Send function schemas in `tools`.
2. When `finish_reason` is `"tool_calls"`, inspect each function name and JSON
   argument object. Apply the client's normal permission checks before running
   the function.
3. Append the assistant message, including its unchanged `tool_calls` and any
   `reasoning_content`. Gemma needs that reasoning between tool calls within
   the current user turn.
4. Append each result as a `role: "tool"` message. Its `tool_call_id` must
   match the call it resolves.
5. Send the complete history and tool schemas again.

The server accepts only function tools. Omit `tool_choice` or set it to `auto`
to allow calls. Set it to `none` to disable them. The server does not support
`required`, named tool selection, or `parallel_tool_calls: false`.

Original Gemma tool-result continuation retains the generated reasoning/KV and prefills
only the verified results and next generation suffix. Repeated function names
and arguments, including multiple calls in one response, are valid. A new
user turn uses Google's canonical history policy; it cannot take the tool-loop
append path to retain thoughts that the template strips. This also corrects
legacy non-thinking history: the empty thought block used to start generation
is not inserted into prior assistant messages by the canonical template.

QAT uses its own installed source template. That template may normalize the
current tool-call turn, so QAT reuse requires an actual matching source prefix;
the server recovers that prefix and recomputes the remaining source-rendered
tokens. Resumed input matches a fresh source render.

## Errors

The prompt is rendered and checked against the context window before any
response is written, so an overlong prompt, an unknown model, an unsupported
parameter, an oversized body, or a full queue comes back as a JSON error
envelope with a real status code — `400`, `404`, `413`, `415`, or `429` — and
no stream is started. Asking for `"stream": true` does not change this.

A failure raised after that point cannot change the status, because a
streaming request already has `200` and the SSE head on the wire. It is
reported in-band instead: one frame carrying an `error` object, then
`data: [DONE]`, then a normal end of the chunked body.

```text
data: {"error":{"message":"generation failed","type":"server_error","code":"internal_error"}}

data: [DONE]

```

The frame carries the same envelope the blocking path would have returned, so
a failure that can only surface once generation is under way still names its
cause. Reusing a KV prefix is the case that reaches it: whether the retained
prefix plus the new turn fits the context window is known only after the
prompt cache has been matched, which happens after the head is committed.

Treat any frame with an `error` key as fatal for that request; no
`finish_reason` chunk precedes it. The stream is never terminated by dropping
the connection, so a client that sees an aborted transport (`TypeError:
terminated` under undici, for example) should look for a dead server process
or its own timeout rather than a generation error.

## Server log

The server writes one line per request to stderr:

```text
[2026-07-31T17:03:10Z] request chatcmpl-f6a02587… started streaming=true
[2026-07-31T17:03:12Z] request chatcmpl-f6a02587… completed in 2.4s prompt=812 cached=768 completion=96 finish=stop
```

The start line is written before the model runs, so a long prefill — which
emits nothing for minutes — is distinguishable from a wedged server. The
completion line reports how much of the prompt the KV prefix supplied in
`cached`, matching `usage.prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens`. The `prefill`
field reports computed prefill time, including any snapshot capture; request
latency also includes prefix matching and snapshot restoration.

A failed request logs the status it would have carried, whether or not a
stream had already committed `200`, along with the underlying error — which is
more detail than the response carries, since responses deliberately do not
leak runtime internals:

```text
[2026-07-31T17:09:32Z] request chatcmpl-b36dd1ed… failed status=400 streaming=true error=context_length_exceeded: prompt exceeds the configured context
```

## Supported API

Endpoints:

- `GET /health`
- `GET /v1/models`
- `POST /v1/chat/completions`
- `POST /v1/models/unload` — library mode only, and a Mference extension rather
  than part of the OpenAI API; see
  [Unloading the model](OPEN_WEBUI.md#unloading-the-model)

Each model in `GET /v1/models` carries `max_model_len`, vLLM's field: the
context window for prompt plus completion that the model runs with. That is
the numeric `--max-context`, or with `--max-context max` the model family's
native context. In library mode it comes from the install index, so listing
loads nothing and answers during a model load.

Chat Completions supports JSON and Server-Sent Events responses. Set
`"stream": true` for streaming. Set
`"stream_options": {"include_usage": true}` to receive a final usage chunk.

For ChatML (including base/Swift Qwen), GLM and MiniCPM, usage also includes
`completion_tokens_details.reasoning_tokens` and the Mference extension
`visible_tokens`. These count generated payload tokens in each channel,
including whitespace and buffered byte tokens, not re-tokenized rendered text.
They exclude channel markers, tool payloads and EOS; their sum need not equal
`completion_tokens`. Visible counts are omitted when a string stop trims an
answer inside a token. Unsupported dialects omit the details object rather
than reporting invented zeros. Reasoning token accounting does not imply that
every checkpoint streams its hidden reasoning text.

Requests may contain system, developer, user, assistant, and tool messages.
Guidance must precede the conversation, and consecutive messages of the same
guidance role are merged into one block separated by a blank line. Only
Gemma's chat template has a distinct `developer` role; with any other family
loaded a `developer` message is treated as a `system` message — it merges
with adjacent system guidance instead of rendering as its own block.
Exception: Swift-Qwen, and base Qwen 3.8 requests with an explicit
`reasoning_effort`, use the source template and reject `developer`; use leading
`system` guidance instead.
Supported options include `temperature`, `top_p`, `top_k`, `min_p`,
`presence_penalty`, `frequency_penalty`, `repetition_penalty` (alias
`repeat_penalty`), `repeat_last_n`, `seed`, `stop`, `max_tokens`,
`max_completion_tokens`, and function-tool fields. Conflicting repetition
aliases are rejected.

All families default to temperature `0.8`, Top-K `40`, Top-P `0.95`, Min-P
`0.05`, repetition penalty `1.0`, presence/frequency penalties `0.0`, and a
64-token penalty window. These match llama.cpp's built-in sampling defaults,
before any GGUF metadata or application overrides. Explicit request values
win. Min-P accepts `0...1`; zero disables it. Presence and frequency each
accept finite values in `-2...2`. `repeat_last_n: 0` disables all history
penalties; `-1` uses the complete effective history. The window includes
cached and newly prefetched prompt tokens plus generated tokens.

The chain is penalties → Top-K → normalized Top-P → Min-P → temperature.
Penalties act on post-softcap logits: positive seen-token logits are divided
by repetition penalty, nonpositive logits multiplied; then subtract
`count * frequency_penalty + presence_penalty`. Counts are restricted to the
penalty window. Nonzero penalties with an enabled window require the logits
path even at temperature zero. See [sampling compatibility](LLAMA_SAMPLING.md).
Top-K accepts `0` (off) or `1...256`; with positive temperature, disabling
Top-K requires `top_p: 1`. Full-vocabulary Min-P remains supported.

Base and Swift Qwen 3.8 accept `reasoning_effort` values `xhigh`, `medium`, `low`,
and `none`. An explicit value uses the source template, retains reasoning in a
separate `reasoning_content` response/history field, and allows only exact
rendered-prefix cache reuse. Preserve that field when replaying history.
Omitted effort retains Swift's source-default xhigh and base Qwen's legacy
behavior; the latter does not stream hidden reasoning. Do not treat those two
omitted-effort policies as a matched fine-tune comparison.

Qwen 3.6 opts into its source thinking template with
`chat_template_kwargs: {"enable_thinking": true}` or an explicit
`reasoning_effort`. For this checkpoint, `none` disables thinking and the other
accepted effort values enable it; omitted controls retain non-thinking
behavior. Explicit `reasoning_effort` takes precedence over `enable_thinking`.
Preserve `reasoning_content` in replayed assistant turns: Qwen 3.6 can continue
the cached generated turn with a verified source-template suffix, including
tool-result rounds. `preserve_thinking` is accepted for compatibility; source
template history always preserves reasoning. Thinking requests without an
explicit completion cap default to 32,768 tokens, subject to available context.
Gemma 4 also accepts these controls, with the policy below. Other models reject
explicit thinking controls. Sampling and MTP defaults remain unchanged.

Gemma 4 thinking is opt-in in both single-model and library mode, including
custom model aliases. Use `chat_template_kwargs: {"enable_thinking": true}`
or `reasoning_effort: "low"|"medium"|"xhigh"`; these three aliases enable the
same binary mode. `none` disables it, and an explicit effort takes precedence
over `enable_thinking`. Omitted controls leave thinking off. Its default
completion cap remains 4,096 tokens, including reasoning; a cap reached during
thought may return empty `content` and `finish_reason: "length"`.

JSON and SSE responses return Gemma thoughts separately as `reasoning_content`.
Replay that field on assistant messages, particularly between tool-result
rounds. Google's template retains thoughts within the active user turn and
strips earlier thoughts when a new user message arrives. For both Gemma
checkpoints, the HTTP server accepts `chat_template_kwargs.preserve_thinking`
for generic-client compatibility and normalizes it to `false` before rendering
and cache matching. Tool-call reasoning remains available within the current
user turn; the selected source template removes older reasoning after a new
user prompt. This option does not enable or disable thinking. Gemma does not
report estimated reasoning-token usage counts.

This changes the former HTTP contract: ordinary Gemma no longer retains older
tool-call thoughts when a client sends `preserve_thinking=true`, and QAT no
longer rejects that value. Clients should continue replaying `reasoning_content`;
the server applies the model's history policy without changing client messages.

The app bundles Google's canonical template at revision
`35b4173cf6211bf5ee1f4c3c8d97cf2a0d89c122`. Existing valid installs need no
weight download or repack. Ordinary and tool chat use the same template;
canonical formatting trims message content and keeps tool responses inside
the model turn. The effective template has its own cache identity. A missing
or damaged template resource requires rebuilding/reinstalling the application,
not the model weights.

The separate `gemma-4-26b-a4b-it-qat-q4_0-mlx-aligned` checkpoint instead uses
its verified installed template and generation settings, including through a
custom alias or library swap. Its thinking switch follows the same opt-in
rules, but its source drops ordinary assistant reasoning and retains tool-call
reasoning only after the latest user message. Every accepted
`preserve_thinking` value follows that source policy, including while queued.
The two checkpoints retain their distinct source templates; their prompt bytes
and cache reuse counts need not be identical. With thinking enabled, a new QAT
model turn starts inside a pre-opened thought channel: the source suffix ends
at the bare model header, where the 26B can skip thinking, so Mference appends
`<|channel>thought\n` to it. After tool results, the source suffix does
not pre-open a thought channel. Reasoning, visible content and tool calls still
use the same separate API fields. See [QAT defaults and qualification](RUNTIME_CONTROLS.md#gemma-qat).

For Qwen 3.6's recommended general-thinking sampling profile, send these
explicit options along with `model` and `messages`:

```json
{
  "chat_template_kwargs": {"enable_thinking": true},
  "temperature": 1.0,
  "top_p": 0.95,
  "top_k": 20,
  "min_p": 0.0,
  "presence_penalty": 1.5,
  "repetition_penalty": 1.0
}
```

These options change sampling policy only, not thinking templates, reasoning
history, tool parsing, or prompt-cache continuation. Presence penalty does
not guarantee that every semantic or textual repetition loop is eliminated.

The server supports one model and one choice. It does not support the Responses
API, legacy Completions, embeddings, multimodal input, structured output,
batching, log probabilities, or remote model switching.

Maple's chat template opens a live `<think>` reasoning block at the start of
every completion. The server suppresses the reasoning text from the response,
but those tokens still count as completion tokens, so give Maple requests a
generous allowance — around 2048 `max_completion_tokens` (when neither cap is
set the server uses 4096) — or the reasoning budget swallows the visible
answer and the request finishes with `finish_reason` `"length"`.

`--max-context` takes any length up to the model's native context (default
16K): 262,144 tokens for Gemma 4 (QAT included), Qwen 3.6, Qwen 3.8 and
Flash-Next; 131,072 for MiniCPM5; 128,000 for Maple; 1,048,576 for
DeepSeek-V4-Flash, Inkling-Small and GLM-5.3-Flash. `--max-context max` gives
every model its own native context, which suits a library of different
models; families that do not grow their KV (all but Gemma 4, Qwen 3.6 and
Inkling) then reserve that whole context when they load. A model whose native
context is shorter refuses to load: with `--model` the server exits at
startup, and in library mode the request that asked for it gets HTTP 400
`context_exceeds_model`. At 262,144 Gemma 4 QAT needs about 9.15 GiB with
server settings, 5.02 GiB of it growing with context.

Gemma 4, Qwen 3.6 and Inkling-Small do not reserve their full-attention KV for
`--max-context` up front. It starts at 16,384 tokens (a context of 16,384 or
less is reserved whole); a prompt that does not fit grows it to the prompt
plus 16,384 tokens, room for the answer, and an answer that outgrows that
adds 8,192 tokens at a time, up to `--max-context`. Each layer reserves
address space for the whole context and grows its Metal buffer over the same
pages, so rows are never copied and the KV is never held twice; a new
conversation starts again from 16,384 and returns the pages. Metal charges a
KV buffer in full once it is bound, so a whole reservation costs memory a
short chat never uses: on a 16 GiB M2 reserving 262,144 instead of 128,000
took 2.6 GiB from the page cache holding routed experts and cut QAT decode
from about 6.3 to 4.6 tok/s. `--kv-reserve` reserves the whole context at load
instead; the other families always do. Pages the GPU writes into a growing
KV count as wired system memory rather than in the server process's own
footprint, so Activity Monitor shows the process smaller than its KV.

Maple uses native BF16
KV with layer-major chunked prefill; existing families use FP16 KV. On an 8 GB Mac,
run one model process at a time and watch memory pressure.
